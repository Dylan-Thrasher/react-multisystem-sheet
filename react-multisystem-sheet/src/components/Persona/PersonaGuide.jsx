            <h3>Stats</h3>
            <h4>Persona Stats</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Strength: Determines the damage of Physical attacks.</li>
            <li>Magic: Determines the result of Magic spells for damage and healing.</li>
            <li>Defense: Determines the amount of Damage Reduction. 3 damage per point</li>
            <li>Vitality: Increases health by 20 per point.</li>
            <li>Agility: Determines your order in combat, along with dodge chance.
                When an opponent rolls your Agility or lower when making an attack, you dodge.
            </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Human Stats</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Expression: Having your intent show through your face and body language in a believable manner. 
                    This also allows you to read the expressions of others accurately if successful.</li>
                <li>Knowledge: Your characterâ€™s collection of information on a wide variety of subjects. 
                    From book smarts to street smarts, if it requires specific information, it falls under this.</li>
                <li>Athletics: How well you can use and control your body, along with general health. 
                    If a fight breaks out in the real world, this will be used similarly to Strength for the Persona.</li>
                <li>Willpower: The ability to press on towards a goal and resist opposition/distraction. 
                    This can be helpful in resisting certain mental-based magic as well.</li>
                <li>Proficiency: The level of ability that a player has in applications that require specific trained skills. 
                    This can range from things like picking a lock to auto-repair.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Critical Hits</h4>
            <p>When attacking, roll a d20. On a physical attack, if the d20 lands on 20, you score a critical hit. This multiplies the damage by 1.5 times and knocks the target down.
                If the result is not higher than the target's Agility score, the attack misses.
