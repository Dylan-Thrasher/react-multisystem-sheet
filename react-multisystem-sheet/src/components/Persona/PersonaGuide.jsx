            {/* Resist vs Weakness for elements*/}
            <h4>Weaknesses and Resistances</h4>
            <p>Weaknesses and Resistances are a specific damage type that has a different effect on a target than usual.
                If a target is hit with a damage type they are weak to, it will do 1.5x damage. 
                If a target is hit with a damage type they are Resistant to, the damage will be reduced by half.
            </p>
            {/* Charts for Dice used */}
            <h4>Dice Progression</h4>
            <p>This system uses the Step Dice style of dice progression. With each point placed in a stat that affects damage, you use the dice below. </p>
            {/* Equipment */}
            <h4>Equipment</h4>
            <p>Your character has 3 equipment slots
                <ul>
                    <li>Weapon: This is the base damage and type your character does without using their Persona.</li>
                    <li>Outfit: This provides a variety of effects, typically a stat boost.</li>
                    <li>Accessory: This can typically provide abilities that can range from general stat boost to very specific circumstances like auto-revive with 1 HP.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            {/* Explanation of Critical Hits and misses */}
            <h4>Critical Hits</h4>
            <p>When attacking, roll a d20. On a physical attack, if the d20 lands on 20, you score a critical hit. This multiplies the damage by 1.5 times and knocks the target down.
                If the result is not higher than the target's Agility score, the attack misses.
            </p>
            {/* Status Effect Descriptions */}
            <h4>Status Effects</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Freeze</li>
                <li>Burn</li>
                <li>Shock</li>
                <li>Panic</li>
                <li>Sleep</li>
                <li>Silence</li>

            </ul>
            {/* All Out Attacks */}
            <h4>All Out Attacks</h4>
            <p>The All Out Attack can be used when all opponents are downed due to being hit by their weaknesses or critical hits.
                The total of the All Out Attack is the total of every participant's weapon. Players who are downed cannot participate in an All Out Attack.
                An All Out Attack completely ignores Defense and Resistances. 
            </p>
            {/* Explanation of status effect removing spells vs healing use */}
            <h4>Healing and Curing</h4>
            <p>Healing spells provide a health recovery based on the tier of spell and magic dice. The recovery can only go as high as up to full.
                Status Effect cure spells can cure status effects if the related spell is used. Depending on the skill, it may be for one or multiple targets.
            </p>
            {/* Social link descriptions */}
            <h4>Social Links</h4>
            <p>Upon getting close to key characters, including other party members, you'll unlock social links.
                When you reach important stages in your interpersonal relationships, this is represented by Social Link ranks.

                When you increase ranks with other PCs, it can give you new abilities in battle.
