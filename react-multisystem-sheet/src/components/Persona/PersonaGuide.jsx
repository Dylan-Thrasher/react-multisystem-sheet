            {/* Resist vs Weakness for elements*/}
            <h4>Weaknesses and Resistances</h4>
            <p>Weaknesses and Resistances are a specific damage type that has a different effect on a target than usual.
                If a target is hit with a damage type they are weak to, it will do 1.5x damage. 
                If a target is hit with a damage type they are Resistant to, the damage will be reduced by half.
            </p>

            {/* Equipment */}
            {/* Explanation of Critical Hits and misses */}
            <h4>Critical Hits</h4>
            <p>When attacking, roll a d20. On a physical attack, if the d20 lands on 20, you score a critical hit. This multiplies the damage by 1.5 times and knocks the target down.
                If the result is not higher than the target's Agility score, the attack misses.
            </p>
            {/* Status Effect Descriptions */}
            {/* All Out Attacks */}
            <h4>All Out Attacks</h4>
            <p>The All Out Attack can be used when all opponents are downed due to being hit by their weaknesses or critical hits.
                The total of the All Out Attack is the total of every participant's weapon. Players who are downed cannot participate in an All Out Attack.
                An All Out Attack completely ignores Defense and Resistances. 
            </p>

            {/* Social link descriptions */}
            <h4>Social Links</h4>
            <p>Upon getting close to key characters, including other party members, you'll unlock social links.
                When you reach important stages in your interpersonal relationships, this is represented by Social Link ranks.
                You can gain various benefits from ranks in social links. NPC social links can provide access to new items or features.
                When you increase ranks with other PCs, it can give you new abilities in battle.
